  <h2>Fighting Style</h2>
  <p>Ali had a highly unorthodox boxing style for a heavyweight (210 pounds), epitomized by his catchphrase "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." 
    Never an overpowering puncher, Ali relied early in his career on his incredible hand speed, superb reflexes and constant movement, dancing and circling 
    opponents for most of the fight, holding his hands low and lashing out with a quick, cutting left jab that he threw from unpredictable angles. His footwork 
    was so strong that it was extremely difficult for opponents to cut down the ring and corner Ali against the ropes. He was also able to quickly dodge 
    punches with his speed, head movement, dancing and footwork.</p>

  <h3>Footwork</h3>
  <p>Ali's footwork was arguably the most iconic part of his fighting style.  The movements themselves were not unsimilar in premise to dancing, as he made his way around the ring in swift, seamless movements.  It is known that Bruce Lee actually took insipration from Ali's footwork and incorporated it into his own brand of martial arts.</p>
