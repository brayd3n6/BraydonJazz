  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>My hobbies are plentiful, and nerdy enough to get bullied in highschool in the 80s.  I was a band kid, I play Dungeons and Dragons, I enjoy playing video games a lot, and I love to workout when I get the time.</p>

  <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
  <p>I've played various tabletop role playing games (or TTRPGs) for over a decade now.  It is hard to describe exactly what the draw of such games are to me.  Maybe it's the ability to whisk you away to new worlds in which you can do as you see fit, be whoever you want to be.  Maybe it's the freedom of choice that cannot be found in any kind of programmed game on the market, with literally infinite choices.  Whatever the reason, it is undeniable how much these games have had an impact on my life.</p>

  <h3>Band</h3>
  <p>While I've been playing instruments for a little under a decade now, I've only been in band for 2 years or so.  I mostly play brass instruments, but I play a multtitude of kinds, such as guitars, accordians, ocarinas, trumpet, tuba, and french horn.  You meet a lot of interesting people in band, some of my best friends were there with me.  it got me through a tough time in my life, and it was always a blasto to be a part of.  The best memory I had from band was performing at the North Bay christmas walk, where we had to play instruments at -20 degrees for over 3 hours.  It was cold, but everybody was laughing and having a grand time.</p

  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  <p>Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  Some of my happiest memories are playing different video games with all my friends from the years.  My favourite genre is strategy games, but I like to jump all over the spectrum.  From first person shooters to farming simulators, I've played a game from every facet of the industry.  I mainly play games on my PC, though I used to have a PS4 a few years back.</p>
