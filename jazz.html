    <h3>What is jazz?</h3>
  <p>Jazz is a form of music that originated in New Orleans U.S.A. in the early 1920s.  Jazz was formed when the triplet-based music of africa blended with the 4/4 rhythms of european music.  This fusion led to the "swing best" growing in popularity.  In the community, sheet music was not widely used.  Instead, most musicians would play by ear, going by their memory and improvising for the rest.  In modern times, the term jazz actually encompasses multiple genres such as funk, soul, blues, swing, and many others.  Jazz music exploded in popularity in the 30s to 40s, died down with the rise of rock and pop in the 60s to the 80s, but made a revival in the 90s spawning bands like the atomic fireballs, the squirrel nut zippers, etc.</p>

  <p>I love jazz because of the passion that can be felt through the improvisation in many of the pieces.  When music is entirely scripted and composed beforehand, you tend to lose a lot of the feeling that comes with writing music.  So much of jazz is composed on the spot, so all the passion comes out in a palpable way that is clear for anyone that hears.  Not only this, but the general instrumental palette of jazz is right up my alley.  I love brass instruments, especially muted trumpets.</p>

<p>Pictured here is Dizzy Gillespie, an absolutely genius trumpet player.  He is best know for his strangely shaped trumpet, and his cheeks that puff out massively when he plays.  My favourite piece of his is "Manteca", written in 1947.</p>

  <p>This week's featured jazz song is Moanin' by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.  The song features a signurature motif heard
  in the beginning with the first few notes.  The theme and feel of the song are slow and meloncholy.  A beautiful classic!</p>

<p>I know the long 9 minute time for this song turns a lot of people off of it, but I actually rather enjoy the length of the piece.  In a way, it's like getting more song per song.  Not only this, but anybody who would want to listen to something shorter can easily just cut the song in half, and only listen to part of it.</p>
